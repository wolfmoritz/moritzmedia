    <h1>Baking with Fritz</h1>
    <p class="lead">Do we really need another baking book? Well -- perhaps not.</p>
    <p class="">Strike that!</p>
    <p class="">Of course, we need to talk about baking!</p>
    <p class="">Gretl, my dear wife, and "Mutti" to our five children, was a great cook and baker. She could whip out a wonderful cake whilepreparing dinner and watching the kids. We all have fond memories of her. She never used a recipe or mixer, and her baking was always perfect.</p>
    <p class="">Missing those good old days, I set out to try this baking business myself. From what I had seen, it hadn't seemed that difficult. I remembered that flour, sugar, and butter were involved. How was it put together? I wasn't sure, but I would manage somehow. Then, just in time, it occurred to me that she might have put in some eggs as well! My cake, in spite of all my fumbling, turned into a beautiful--dense brick!</p>
    <p class="">That was the day I decided to find out how to bake a "good" cake or bread. After two years of baking, researching the subject, and countless disappointments, my cakes and breads turn out quite well. How well? My children rave about it!</p>
    <p class="">This binder is filled with a collection of facts and baking methods, along with my comments on what I have learned during these many years, and of course our favorite recipes like Swiss Roll, Haselnusskranz, and rustic breads.</p>
    <p class="">I hope you will enjoy reading these pages, and perhaps even discover some facts you may not know mattered. In which case, it was well worth my effort. All the best to you, and have a good time!</p>
    <p class="">Your baking friend <span class="">Fritz</span>
    <h3>I dedicate this manual to you, my dear Gretl</h3>
